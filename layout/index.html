            Vertigo (1958) is a psychological suspense film directed by the British filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock and is widely regarded as one of the greatest works in cinema history. Starring James Stewart and Kim Novak, the film tells the story of a retired detective, Scottie, who suffers from acrophobia and becomes entangled in a haunting mystery of illusion, identity, and obsession.

              Themes and Visual Innovation
            </h3>
            <p>
              Through its distinctive visual language and symbolic imagery, Vertigo explores themes such as the male gaze, fixation, and the reconstruction of identity. Hitchcock’s innovative use of the “dolly zoom” technique visually expresses the protagonist’s fear and psychological descent. The film’s layered narrative unfolds through a complex interplay of love and death, revealing humanity’s distorted pursuit of idealized perfection and unattainable desire.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Although Vertigo received mixed reviews upon its initial release, it has since been re-evaluated and celebrated as a cinematic landmark. In 2012, it famously surpassed Citizen Kane in Sight & Sound magazine’s critics’ poll, earning the title of “the greatest film of all time.” Today, Vertigo remains an essential text for studying psychological storytelling and cinematic form.
