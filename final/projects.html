        <h3>Project Objectives & Strategy</h3>
        <p>I defined the core communication goals of the public service campaign, identifying the behavioral risks posed by AI-driven telecom fraud and formulating a strategic framework for effective intervention. My responsibilities included determining key message priorities, outlining the advertisement's narrative logic, and designing a communication strategy that balanced educational clarity with creative engagement.</p>

        <h3>Market Research</h3>
        <p>I conducted user-behavior analysis focusing on vulnerable groups, including older adults and individuals unfamiliar with technology. Through structured interviews, scenario simulations, and platform-mapping, I identified their media consumption habits, risk awareness gaps, and preferred information channels. These insights guided the selection of messaging tone, visuals, and communication formats to maximize comprehension and accessibility.</p>

        <h3>Creative Development & Execution</h3>
        <p>I led the ideation and execution of the full advertising concept, transforming research insights into a cohesive creative narrative. This included developing copy directions, designing visual style frames, drafting storyboards, and establishing execution guidelines for production teams. My creative work ensured that educational information was delivered clearly while maintaining high emotional impact and strong memorability.</p>

        <h2>Assignment Project: Avant Gardner Music Festival — Public Service Campaign on Overdose-Reversal Medication (2025)</h2>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Project Background Research</h3>
        <p>I investigated the behaviors, risk patterns, and health challenges of music-festival attendees by examining lifestyle habits, on-site environmental factors, and substance-use trends. This research allowed me to identify the primary reasons for low awareness of emergency overdose medication and pinpoint high-risk moments during a festival where intervention messaging could be most effective.</p>

        <h3>Creative Concepting</h3>
        <p>I designed a creative PSA concept tailored to the sensory and cultural atmosphere of large-scale music festivals. The concept integrated festival-appropriate colors, typography, and tone to ensure the messaging felt natural rather than intrusive. I structured the campaign to balance urgency with empathy, presenting life-saving information in a format that felt culturally relevant and easy for festival-goers to absorb.</p>

        <h3>Communication Strategy Planning</h3>
        <p>I developed a multi-layered communication plan that combined social media outreach, on-site signage, and integrated event-based messaging. I identified touchpoints where attendees were most receptive, such as entry checkpoints, rest areas, and hydration stations, ensuring the PSA reached audiences in moments of relevance and close attention.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Data Collection & Analysis</h3>
        <p>I conducted quantitative and qualitative data collection across both platforms, analyzing user growth patterns, consumption behaviors, community attributes, and content ecology. I organized large datasets to identify structural differences between Xiaohongshu’s recommendation-based community model and Weibo’s open-network social model.</p>

        <h3>Business Model Framework Analysis</h3>
        <p>I constructed a comparative business-model framework covering revenue streams, value-chain logic, commercial partnerships, and long-term platform sustainability. My analysis identified core profit drivers, brand collaboration mechanisms, and monetization pathways unique to each platform.</p>

        <h3>Report Writing & Presentation</h3>
        <p>I integrated all findings into a detailed professional report and presented it through a structured PPT using data visualization, comparative tables, and strategic conclusions. The presentation translated complex data into actionable insights on digital media monetization.</p>

        <h3>Documentary Filming & Editing</h3>
        <p>I produced a short documentary, managing cinematography, audio recording, interview framing, and narrative editing. I ensured the final documentary maintained authenticity while presenting a coherent, emotionally engaging narrative.</p>

        <h3>Website Building & Content Publishing</h3>
        <p>I designed and developed a website to present research findings, integrating video, photography, and written analysis into an accessible public platform.</p>
