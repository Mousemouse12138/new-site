        <h2>Steinhardt: Media, Culture, and Communication</h2>

        </div>

        <p>
          I have chosen to study Media, Culture, and Communication (MCC) at NYU Steinhardt because this program offers a deeply interdisciplinary, globally oriented approach to understanding how media, technology, culture, and society intersect and evolve. The MCC curriculum encourages critical reflection on the historical, political, social, and cultural dimensions of media and communication — from traditional forms to digital media and emerging technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          In MCC, you learn not only to analyze media content, but to situate it within broader global contexts: media history and theory, visual culture, digital media and technology, media infrastructures, race, gender, politics, and international flows of information. This helps you understand not just “what media says,” but “how media shapes society — and how society shapes media.
        </p>

        <p>
          For me, as someone who has always been passionate about media, design, culture, and creative production, and has practical experience in content creation (social media, visual design, video editing), MCC resonates deeply. Given my prior projects (public service ad campaigns, creative cultural competitions, documentary-style field research, social media management), I believe MCC will provide the analytical foundation, theoretical perspectives, and creative freedom to channel those experiences into a more professional, strategic, and globally aware media career.
        </p>

        <p>
          More specifically, I am especially attracted to MCC because I want to work at the intersection of media, business, marketing, and creative projects: doing brand and content strategy for entertainment or media-tech companies; designing creative campaigns; analyzing audience behavior; exploring how global media trends shape consumer culture and societal values. With MCC’s globally oriented, interdisciplinary training, I expect to gain the skills and vision to engage in marketing, media business, creative production, or strategic communication roles in the future, which align well with my long-term goals.
