		<h2 id="singing">My Interest - Singing</h2>
		<p>Singing has always been one of my favorite hobbies and an important 
		part of my daily life. I see it not only as a form of entertainment but 
		also as a personal way to express my emotions. Whenever I sing, I feel 
		a sense of freedom and release, as if I can turn my thoughts and feelings 
		into music.

		I enjoy exploring different genres, from soft ballads to more powerful ones 
		and energetic songs. Each style challenges me in a different way, 
		allowing me to discover new aspects of my own voice. Singing also helps 
		me develop discipline, since it takes patience and practice to improve 
		tone, breath control, and confidence on higher notes.

		What makes singing even more meaningful to me is the way it brings people 
		together. Sharing music with friends or singing in a group always creates 
		a warm atmosphere where everyone feels closer. For me, singing is not just 
		a hobby, but a way to bring joy and connection into my life and the lives 
		of others..</p>
		<h2 id="designing">My Interest - Designing</h2>
		<p>Design is another hobby that inspires me and gives me endless room for 
		creativity. I enjoy creating posters because they combine both visual 
		storytelling and clear communication. For me, designing a poster is like 
		finding the perfect balance between images, colors, and text to capture 
		attention and engagingly deliver a message. Every new project feels 
		like a chance to experiment with different layouts and styles.

		I am also fascinated by character design, where imagination meets artistic 
		detail. When I sketch or develop a character, I think about not just their 
		appearance, but also the story and personality behind them. This process 
		enables me to bring unique ideas to life, transforming simple concepts into 
		visually compelling identities. Whether it is posters, characters, or other 
		creative projects, design always excites and motivates me to continually 
		improve my skills.
